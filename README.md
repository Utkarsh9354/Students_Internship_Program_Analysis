# Students_Internship_Program_Analysis

This project involves analyzing real-world data collected from a Google Form filled out by students who wish to participate in an internship program offered by a company where I previously worked. The goal of this analysis is to increase the sales of the company by understanding student preferences and trends related to internship courses.

1.	What are the top 5 most popular internship courses among students?
2.	What is the total number of students from each department?
3.	What is the distribution of students by year ('First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Graduation')  and department?
4.	Which internship courses are most popular among first-year students?
5.	Which department has the highest enrollment for internship courses?
6.	What is the distribution of students across different academic years (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Graduation) for each internship course?
7.	What is the average enrollment for internship courses across different departments?
8.	Which internship courses have the highest enrollment among graduate students?
9.	What percentage of students who have graduated enroll in internship courses?
10.	How many students have enrolled in internship courses related to emerging technologies like Cyber Security, IoT, or Robotics?
11.	What are the top three internship courses preferred by MBA students?
12.	Which college has the highest enrollment in "Artificial Intelligence"?
13.	Which course is the most popular among students?
14.	Which college year has the highest enrollment?
15.	How many graduated students have enrolled in "Artificial Intelligence"?
16.	Which students have selected 'others' as their internship course and 'others' as their department, and what are their corresponding email addresses?
