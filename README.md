# Students_Internship_Program_Analysis

This project involves analyzing real-world data collected from a Google Form filled out by students who wish to participate in an internship program offered by a company where I previously worked. The goal of this analysis is to increase the sales of the company by understanding student preferences and trends related to internship courses.

#Dataset
The dataset consists of responses from students interested in various internship programs. It includes details such as the student's name, email, college, year of study, department, and the courses they are interested in.
